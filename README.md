# QAP2-SQL-PostgreSQL
This project consists of two SQL-based scenarios aimed at managing systems for university course enrollments and an online store’s inventory and orders.

Problem 1: University Course Enrollment System
In this scenario, we develop a database to manage students, professors, courses, and enrollments. Key tasks include:

Creating tables for students, professors, courses, and enrollments.
Inserting data for students, professors, and courses.
Writing queries to retrieve student enrollments and course details.
Updating and deleting data from the enrollment system.

Problem 2: Online Store Inventory and Orders System
This part simulates an online store’s inventory and order tracking. The system manages products, customers, orders, and the items in each order. Key tasks include:

Creating tables for products, customers, orders, and order items.
Inserting data for products, customers, and orders.
Writing queries to retrieve product information and order details.
Updating stock quantities after an order and deleting an order and its associated items.
